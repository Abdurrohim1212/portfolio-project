                This mini-project is a mandatory agenda held by Binar academy
                and Glints for students at Glints Academy as well as for us in
                batch #10. At its initiation, we were divided into 6 groups,
                each consisting of front-end, back-end and React Native students
                which later is expected to produce a work that can be exhibited
                as a portfolio. This Movieapp is the result of the work of the E
                team where we collaborated for 1 week to finish as much as we
                could.
